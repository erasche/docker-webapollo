From the [GMOD Wiki](http://gmod.org/wiki/WebApollo)

> WebApollo is a browser-based tool for visualisation and editing of sequence
> annotations. It is designed for distributed community annotation efforts,
> where numerous people may be working on the same sequences in geographically
> different locations; real-time updating keeps all users in sync during the
> editing process.

This container is a work in progress, with the end goals of

- configurable database backend (linked container, postgres socket, postgres TCP connection)
- ability to add users via ENV

With the side goals of:

- Turning WebApollo into a Galaxy [Interactive Environment](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Admin/IEs?highlight=%28interactive%29%7C%28environment%29)
