> WebApollo is a browser-based tool for visualisation and editing of sequence
> annotations. It is designed for distributed community annotation efforts,
> where numerous people may be working on the same sequences in geographically
> different locations; real-time updating keeps all users in sync during the
> editing process.

This container is a work in progress, so please be aware of that.

## Running the Container

The container is publicly available as `erasche/webapollo`. Running it requires a postgres database container.


By default, the container includes no data! If you would like to load the
example *Pythium Ultimum* data, your launch command will be a little bit
different:

```console
$ wget http://icebox.lbl.gov/webapollo/data/pyu_data.tgz
$ tar xvfz pyu_data.tgz
$ docker-compose up -d
````

WebApollo will boot, and be available on
[http://localhost:8080/apollo/](http://localhost:8080/apollo/). The username is
`web_apollo_admin` and the password is `password`.

## Building the Container Locally

A `docker-compose.yml` file is available for building the container. Simply run:

```console
$ docker-compose up -d
```

to build and bring up the two linked containers. To load the Pythium data, execute the following before `docker-compose up`

```console
$ wget http://icebox.lbl.gov/webapollo/data/pyu_data.tgz
$ tar xvfz pyu_data.tgz
```

## TODO:

- Blat
- Turning WebApollo into a Galaxy [Interactive Environment](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Admin/IEs?highlight=%28interactive%29%7C%28environment%29)

## Environment Variables

Several configurable parameters are exposed as environment variables that can be set per-container. If you need more, just create a new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/erasche/docker-webapollo/issues/new).

Variable                   | Use
-------------------------- | ---
`APOLLO_ORGANISM`          | Organism name for use in main display
`APOLLO_AUTHENTICATION`    | Authentication class name. [Docs](http://webapollo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Configure/#database-configuration)
`APOLLO_USERNAME`          | Default username for logging in. This account is added automatically, and permissions on any fasta files are automatically given to that user.
`APOLLO_PASSWORD`          | Default password for logging in.
`APOLLO_TRANSLATION_TABLE` | NCBI Translation Table ID
`DB_IS_CHADO`              | Not currently used, but in the future will inform Apollo that the database is a Chado instance and can be used for persisting annotations
`GOLR_URL`                 | URL for the GOLR server


## `REMOTE_USER` Authentication

Some sites prefer `REMOTE_USER` type authentication through an upstream proxy
like Apache or Nginx.

In order to use this type of authentication, you'll need to do a couple things. It's highly recommended that you use fig (or similar) to manage the images at this point:

Here's an example `docker-compose.yml` appropriate for that:

```yaml
db:
    image: postgres:9.4
webapollo:
    image: erasche/webapollo
    links:
        - db
    ports:
        - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
        - ./pyu_data:/data
    environment:
        APOLLO_AUTHENTICATION: org.bbop.apollo.web.user.remoteuser.RemoteUserAuthentication
```

This will enable the RemoteUser authentication. Please make sure your upstream
proxy (e.g. apache) is sending a username in the `REMOTE_USER` header. (You can
check with a command like `sudo tcpdump -A -s 0 'tcp port 8080' -i lo` and
looking for the request headers)

Once you log in, you'll get a permission denied error and not be able to see
any tracks. You can fix that by running a script to add specific users to a
track:

```console
$ docker ps | grep webapollo 
$ # Get the running image ID
$ docker exec -it d0b682d8a9ac /bin/bash
root@d0b682d8a9ac:/usr/local/tomcat# /bin/register-user.sh username@fqdn.edu
Processing Annotations-Bob
```

## Track Configuration

Currently the image uses an "Autodetection" tool in order to automatically load
available track data and attempt to present it in a useful manner. However,
sites may want a more customisable experience.

The startup script can easily be overridden by providing a shell script named
"autodetect.sh" in the root of the mounted volume. You can view [the
default](https://github.com/erasche/docker-webapollo/blob/master/autodetect.sh)
script for ideas of how to extend your version.
